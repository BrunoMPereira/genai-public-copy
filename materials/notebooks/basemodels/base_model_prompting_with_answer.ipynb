    "- Loading a dataset using pandas.\n",

    "- Sending prompts to an API endpoint for text generation.\n",
    "- Parsing and displaying the responses.\n",

    "Initial performances were very low due to mismatch of hyperbolic endpoint. I changed it and began to get some results. Zero shot does not even get that it is supposed to give positive, neutral or negative, getting as an answer integers sometimes. With few shot separated by some delimiters and with a structure it is possible to get good accuracy around 50 % (with previous tests i got 65%, maybe has to do with the api waiting and not getting the result(?)). And I made two more versions to test if more examples would improve the accuracy or if the sentiment keyword would impact results. In this case i got the same accuracy on the refined and refined plus, having different precision metrics. This means the model actually correctly predicts the target class with less examples... However i got better accuracy (60 > 50) with the few_shot that do not have sentiment word. Which in turn leads to me wondering if what improves is actually the use of special characters delimiting the prompt and the response and not the use of words by itself, such as \"text:\" or \"sentiment:\""
